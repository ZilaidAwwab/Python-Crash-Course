# Introducing while Loops

# The for loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once for each item in the collection. In contrast, the while loop runs as long as, or while, a certain condition is true.


# 	The while loop in action
current_number = 1
while current_number <= 5:
    print(current_number)
    current_number += 1
