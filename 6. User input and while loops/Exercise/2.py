# Restaurant Seating: Write a program that asks the user how many people are in their dinner group. If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying theyâ€™ll have to wait for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready.

guests = int(input("Enter the number people in the dinner group: "))
if guests >= 8:
    print("You will have to wait for a table")
else:
    print("The table is ready")
