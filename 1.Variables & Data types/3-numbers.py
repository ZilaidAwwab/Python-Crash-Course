# Ops with integers

# You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python. 

a = 3 + 2
b = 10 - 6
c = 3 * 8
d = 36 / 6
# int division in python3 results in float if reqiured, while in python2 an int division results in int, if none of the operand is float


# Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents
e = 2 ** 3

# Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple  operations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the order of operations
f = (2 + 3) * 9


# Ops with floats

# Python calls any number with a decimal point a float. This term is used in  most programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point can appear at any position in a number.
