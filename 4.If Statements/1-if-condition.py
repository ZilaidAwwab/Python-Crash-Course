# OMITTING THE ELSE
# We are not restricted to use else block must, we can just skip that and handle all the possible conditions with elif


# MULTIPLE IF STATEMENTS
# sometimes itâ€™s important to check all of the conditions of interest. In this case, you should use a series of simple if statements with no elif or else blocks. This technique makes sense when more than one condition could be True, and you want to act on every condition that is True
