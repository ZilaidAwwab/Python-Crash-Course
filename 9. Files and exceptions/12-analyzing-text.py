# Analyzing text (using split method)

# The split() method separates a string into parts wherever it finds a space and stores all the parts of the string in a list. The result is a list of words from the string, although some punctuation may also appear with some of the words. To count the number of words in Alice in Wonderland, weâ€™ll use split() on the entire text.

# Here we are counting the number of words in a file

filename = "alice.txt"

try:
    with open(filename, encoding="utf-8") as f_obj:
        content = f_obj.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    msg = f"{filename} doesn't exist"
    print(msg)
else:
    words = content.split()
    num_words = len(words)
    print("The file " + filename + " has about " + str(num_words) + " words.")
