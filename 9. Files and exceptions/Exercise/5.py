# Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.

print("This program adds the number you provide")
print("Press q to quit the program")

try:
    number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Enter a valid number")

else:
    sums = number1 + number2
    print(sums)
