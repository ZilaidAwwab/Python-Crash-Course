# Nesting

# Sometimes you’ll want to store a set of dictionaries in a list or a list of items as a value in a dictionary. This is called nesting. You can nest a set of dictionaries inside a list, a list of items inside a dictionary, or even a dictionary inside another dictionary.

# A list of dictionaries
alien_0 = {"color": "green", "points": 5}
alien_1 = {"color": "yellow", "points": 10}
alien_2 = {"color": "blue", "points": 15}

aliens = [alien_0, alien_1, alien_2]

for alien in aliens:
    print(alien)
